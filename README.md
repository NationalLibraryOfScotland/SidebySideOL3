SidebySideOL3
==============================

This <a href="https://geo.nls.uk/maps/dev/NLSSideBySideOL3/index.html">application</a> uses <a href="https://openlayers.org/">OpenLayers v 3.20</a>, and three sample <a href="https://www.maptiler.com/">MapTiler</a> georeferenced mosaics to form a split-screen / dual-map window viewer for comparing historical georeferenced map mosaics to present-day map layers. Searching is possible by zooming in on the map, with options to change the map layers between OpenStreetMap, Stamen and Bing layers. The position of the mouse is shown by a cross with a slave pointer in the other map window.

<a href="https://geo.nls.uk/maps/dev/NLSSideBySideOL3/index.html">This application</a> was developed by the <a href="https://www.nls.uk">National Library of Scotland<a> in 2012. We hope that other libraries, archives or institutions may find the code helpful in making available their geographical collections.
