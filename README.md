SidebySideOL3
==============================

This <a href="http://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/side-by-side/">application</a> uses <a href="http://openlayers.org/">OpenLayers v 3.20</a>, a and three sample <a href="http://www.maptiler.com/">MapTiler</a> georeferenced mosaics to form a split-screen / dual-map window viewer for historical georeferenced map mosaics. Searching is possible by zooming in on the map, with options to change the map layers between OpenStreetMap, Stamen and Bing layers. The position of the mouse is shown by a cross with a slave pointer on the other window.

<a href="http://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/side-by-side/">This application</a> was developed by the <a href="http://www.nls.uk">National Library of Scotland<a> in 2012. We hope that other libraries, archives or institutions may benefit from the code in making available their geographical collections.

View a more <a href="http://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/side-by-side/">complete working version of the application</a> on the National Library of Scotland Map Images website.
